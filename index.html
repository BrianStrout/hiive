              <p>
                Paulo Albuquerque (Rio de Janeiro, 1988) is an artist, graduated
                from the Faculty of Fine Arts of the University of Lisbon. His
                works are mostly paintings, illustrations and murals, where he
                presents dynamic compositions developed from different elements,
                colors and textures that interconnect and tell stories. Inspired
                by human relationships, social habits, spaces and objects, his
                work is expressed through metaphors of his experiences and his
                daily life. “I just try to expose my view of the world and
                society, some personal concerns and thoughts. My work starts
                from what I observe and what I absorb. From there, I try to
                create atmospheres and try to tell stories.”

              <p>
                Originally from Venice, California, Sam has been living and
                working in Lisboa for the past 10 years. Self-taught and ever
                evolving stylistically, his approach is unique to himself. For
                the past several years, his focus has been on painting (oil on
                wood and panel) snapshots from ordinary life in both Lisboa and
                Venice, with many of his reference photos being taken directly
                out of his driver's side window. Light, shadows, saturated
                colors and the juxtaposition of leafy nature within an urban
                landscape tickle his fancy. Sam has been building his own frames
                for several years and customizes each one to compliment the tone
                of the painting.

                Ike Ferreira (born 1982, Sao Paulo, Brazil). Enrolled in
                Architecture and Urbanism at FAAP (São Paulo, Brazil) in 2002
                and was awarded the first place in a group competition
                representing the university for the 6th International School
                Competition of the 6th. International Architecture Biennial at
                São Paulo in 2005. In 2006 he moved to Brisbane, Australia to
                deepen his knowledge on such fields of Photography and
                Architecture at Queensland University of Technology. Having
                graduated in 2008 at Fundacao Armando Alvares Penteado, he
                worked with architecture until 2015, having worked among the
                biggest architectural companies in the world. In the pursuit of
                his passion for art he then decided to make it his main activity
                since 2016. When he moved from Sao Paulo to Lisbon. In his work,
                the relations between the human being and the space in which
                they inhabit are constantly represented by visual and non-visual
                structures often imposed by society, culture, politics and the
                individual behaviour. It's always about an image of an imaginary
                space created by ourselves and art is what that image represent
                to each of us.

                Caldas da Rainha. After numerous travels, a year of art curating
                master's studies, and some roles as an art director, she
                discovered her expressive outlet through ceramics. While living
                in Argentina, she studied for three years under sculptor and
                visual artist Veronica Funes. It was there that "Pratos da

                into today's pieces, and creating objects inspired by
                traditional embroidery patterns. Inês's portfolio is a fusion of

                Originating from the north east of the United States, Brian J
                Strout is now found hunkered down in Lisbon. After departing
                from pursuing a degree in Art Education, he spent the greater
                part of two decades as a tradesmen based out of Boston’s working
                class neighborhood, Roxbury. Brian can now be found distributing
                art and poetry, left shyly at bars and galleries for strangers,
                as he tries to tackle his longing for community and expression,
                while still at odds with modern day social structures and
                capitalism. Whether shared, or stowed away in his family’s
                basement, his pieces tend to revolve around his personal
                relationships and ongoing quiet dances with mental health.
