          <u>Artists:</u> <br />To be confirmed upon "signing on" below :)
          <br /><br />
          <u>Point of Contact</u>:Brian Strout, reachable via instagram or
          whatsapp. Number will be posted here and shared with people in current
          conversations when we are all set up.

          <b><u>Exhibit Concept:</u></b>

          <br />
          Artists from the greater Lisbon area will be given two matching
          picture frames(supplied by curator) of the same size( 30cm x 40cm
          inner dim.) to create individual art based on how the artist
          interprets the title of the exhibit. Artists are encouraged to
          acknowledge the frame’s dimensions but not feel restricted by it.
          Frames have been ordered and are expected to arrive around the 26th of
          December.
          <br /><br />

          <b><u>Artwork made by artist</u></b
          ><br />
          Altering of supplied frames is allowed providing at least three
          corners of the frame are left as supplied to uphold the homogeneous
          aesthetic. Of the 2 pieces Artists will supply to the show at least
          one should have an unaltered frame(again to help establish the
          aesthetic across the room/studio.)

          <br /><br />The picture frames are black and have a thin wooden frame
          around them. The backing board is 30 x 40 cm and when placed in the
          frame 1/2 of a cm is covered by the frame so your displayed artwork if
          inside of the frame will actually sit at 29 x 39cm. You are not
          require to use the backer, and can leave out or replace if your piece
          needs something else or nothing in it's place. <br /><br />
          <div class="framephoto"></div>
          <br />
          The gallery kind enough to host us does have a commission for sales so
          they can also keep their lights on. Per the gallery's inhouse policy,
          this was determined to be 40%, of which 20% goes to the gallery and
          20% to the currator.
          <br /><br />
          <b><u>Presentation</u></b
          ><br />
          Art pieces would be unlabeled in the show, however there will be
          booklets available for guests upon arrival that would contain a key to
          the exhibit, listing prices, with a description of the effort, as well
          as artist bios(where they can introduce themselves briefly and help
          people in the show find your work elsewhere/online/etc.) I have quoted
          out proper books for the event and will update people on this in the
          next few weeks as I collect content from artists.
          <br /><br />
          <b><u>Photos for promotional content</u></b
          ><br />
          Artists need to provide 2 photos, one of a straight forward “selfie”
          <b> blank expression </b> (think like a driver's license please) and
          also whatever they would like to be included with their bio. I will
          make promotional videos for advertising/sharing online as well as this
          page will turn into a landing page for the event online. I will share
          it under a new account hiivelisbon (on instagram) which I will be
          using for this and some other events down the line. In case you are
          curious the blank selfie is so I can match people faces easier while
          make promotional content. I would like to use it as a 9 square grid
          rubrics cube-ish transition. I don't expect ever actually see the
          whole photo. Artists should, I hope, be enthusiastic to help share
          this content to spread the word when it becomes available.
          <br /><br />
          <b><u>Opening Event Notes</u></b>
          <br />
          We will be setting up a photobooth-like setting for the reception, and
          would happily take some help with this as the design comes together,
          if you are interested. Not required.
          <br /><br />

          <b><u>Food and Beverage:</u></b>
          <br />
          The event currently will be sponsored by Musa! Exploring some other
          options
          <br /><br />
          I need to stress that anything we do to the gallery needs to be
          undone, and as the curator I'm on the hook for this at the end of the
          day so please please talk to me before hand if you are consindering
          making your piece impact the gallery more than just mounting a frame
          to the wall. I'm happy to explore things with you but want to make
          sure we're not biting off more than we can chew.
          <br /><br />
          <br /><br />Any questions please let me know, this will serve as a
          catch all for keeping everyone on the same page, and as the date gets
          closer this will turn into an independent landing page for the event

              with 2 previous days for setting up and the immediate next day
              after the exhibition for dismantling it.
            </li>
            <li>
              Besides the big exhibition room, we have one kitchen and a
              bathroom that can be used too.
            </li>
            <li>Please note the artist studio can not be accessed at all!</li>
            <li>Dates of exhibition: March 14, 15 and 16, 2024</li>
            <li>Schedules: to be defined (usually from 5 to 8 or 6 to 9 pm</li>
            <li>Please note: 9 pm maximum due to licenses)</li>
            <li>Extra days for production: March 12, 13 and 17.</li>
            <li>
              The artists can access and use the space only with the curator
              (Brian) supervision, during the schedule from 9 am to 9 pm
              (exceptionally other allowed persons can access it too during this
              period for production reasons).
            </li>
            <li>
              The space must be delivered on Sunday March 17 at 9 pm max, at the
              exact same conditions as it was at the time the keys were handed
              on the set up day ( March 12, 9 am)
            </li>
            <li>
              No parties allowed - with the exception of the open day until 9 pm
              - and no smoking inside (of any kind).
            </li>
            <li>
              Please do not use our materials with no permission, a lot of
              artroom tools have been disappearing in the last years so each
              artist is responsible for bringing his own materials for setting
              up.
            </li>
            <li>
              We kindly ask that all the remains of food, drinks and garbage are
              immediately removed from the gallery.
            </li>
            <li>
              Considering it’s a building from the XIX century and for
              structural reasons, no dancing is possible nor very loud music for
              respect to our neighbours and Pavilhão Chinês the Bar bellow us.
              However it’s possible to have music, we always have :)
            </li>
            <li>
              If the client asks for an invoice, which is not very frequent, is
              the artist responsibility to do it since it’s the artist that
              receives the total payment and pays the curator and the gallery
              commissions after. The gallery will invoice the value of its 20%
              commission to the artist if needed. The total sale will be shared
              the following way, 60% for the artist 20% for the curator and 20%
              for the gallery.
