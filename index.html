          <h2>Title of Exhibit: Lisboa e Lonely</h2>

          <span class="spanblock"
            >Location: Art Room, Principe Real, Lisbon</span
          >
          <span class="spanblock"> Date: March 14, 15 and 16, 2024</span>
          <u>Artists:</u> <br />To be confirmed upon "signing" agreement.
          <br /><br />
          <ul>
            Exhibit Concept:
          </ul>
          <br />
          9 artist from the greater Lisbon area will be given two matching
          picture frames of the same size(tbd) to create individual art based on
          how the artist interprets the title of the exhibit. Artists are
          encouraged to acknowledge the frame’s dimensions but not feel
          restricted by it. <br /><br />
          Altering of supplied frames is allowed providing at least three
          corners of the frame are left as supplied to uphold the homogeneous
          aesthetic. Of the 2 pieces Artists will supply to the show at least
          one should have un altered frame(again to help establish the aesthetic
          across the room/studio) Art pieces will be expected to be available
          for sale, typically pieces in this gallery don’t list for less than
          $350, so ideally artist’s unfamiliar with the quality of work
          displayed here will keep this in mind while creating their pieces. The
          gallery kind enough to host us does charge a commission for sales so
          they can also keep their lights on. Per the gallery's inhouse policy,
          this was determined to be 40%, of which 20% goes to the gallery and
          20% to the currator.
          <br /><br />
          Art pieces would be unlabeled in the show, however there will be
          booklets available for guests upon arrival that would contain a key to
          the exhibit, with a description of the effort, as well as artist
          bios(where they can introduce themselves briefly and help people in
          the show find your work elsewhere/online/etc.) I am quoting out these
          books now.
          <br /><br />
          <u>Opening Event Notes</u>
          <br />
          I also intend to set up a photobooth like setting for the reception,
          and would happily take some help with this as the design comes
          together, if you are interested.
          <br /><br />
          <u>Photos</u><br />
          Artists need to provide 2 photos, one of a straight forward “selfie”
          blank expression and also whatever they would like to be included with
          their bio. I will make promotional videos for advertising/sharing
          online as well as this page will turn into a landing page for the
          event online. I will share it under a new account hiivelisbon which I
          will be using for this and some other potentiol events down the line.
          Artists should, I hope, be enthusiastic to help share this content to
          spread the word when it becomes available.
          <br /><br />
          <u>Food and Beverage:</u>
          <br />
          tbd, I am more than happy to get help in this department if you have
          some recommendations.
          <br /><br />

          <br /><br />Any questions please let me know, this will serve as a
          catch all for keeping everyone on the same page, and as the date gets
          closer this will turn into an independent landing page for the event

          <h2>Show Agreement</h2>
          ARTROOM’s conditions for planned group show at our gallery.
          <ul>

            <li>Thursday- opening day</li>
            <li>Friday and Saturday - viewing days</li>
            <li>
              with 2 previous days for setting up and the immediate next day
              after the exhibition for dismantling it.
            </li>
            <li>
              Besides the big exhibition room, we have one kitchen and a
              bathroom that can be used too.
            </li>
            <li>Please note the artist studio can not be accessed at all!</li>
            <li>Dates of exhibition: March 14, 15 and 16, 2024</li>
            <li>Schedules: to be defined (usually from 5 to 8 or 6 to 9 pm</li>
            <li>Please note: 9 pm maximum due to licenses)</li>
            <li>Extra days for production: March 12, 13 and 17.</li>
            <li>
              The artists can access and use the space only with the curator
              (Brian) supervision, during the schedule from 9 am to 9 pm
              (exceptionally other allowed persons can access it too during this
              period for production reasons).
            </li>
            <li>
              The space must be delivered on Sunday March 17 at 9 pm max, at the
              exact same conditions as it was at the time the keys were handed
              on the set up day ( March 12, 9 am)
            </li>
            <li>
              No parties allowed - with the exception of the open day until 9 pm
              - and no smoking inside (of any kind).
            </li>
            <li>
              Please do not use our materials with no permission, a lot of
              artroom tools have been disappearing in the last years so each
              artist is responsible for bringing his own materials for setting
              up.
            </li>
            <li>
              We kindly ask that all the remains of food, drinks and garbage are
              immediately removed from the gallery.
            </li>
            <li>
              Considering it’s a building from the XIX century and for
              structural reasons, no dancing is possible nor very loud music for
              respect to our neighbours and Pavilhão Chinês the Bar bellow us.
              However it’s possible to have music, we always have :)
            </li>
            <li>
              If the client asks for an invoice, which is not very frequent, is
              the artist responsibility to do it since it’s the artist that
              receives the total payment and pays the curator and the gallery
              commissions after. The gallery will invoice the value of its 20%
              commission to the artist if needed. The total sale will be shared
              the following way, 60% for the artist 20% for the curator and 20%
              for the gallery.
            </li>
          </ul>
